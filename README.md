# bsp-layout
Manage layouts in bspwm (tall and wide)

[BSPWM](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) does one thing and it does it well. It is a window manager. But some workflows require layout management to some extent. `bsp-layout` fills that gap.

### Usage

* Help menu
```bash
bsp-layout help
```

* Set a layout in desktop named 6
Not specifying the desktop will apply the layout on the focused desktop
```bash
bsp-layout set tall 6
```

* Set tall layout to desktop with a 40% split
Set the master size for layout
```bash
// Currently focused workspace
bsp-layout set tall -- --master-size 0.4

// Workspace 6
bsp-layout set tall 6 -- --master-size 0.4
```

* Remove layout applied to desktop named 6
This will remove any layout applied
```bash
bsp-layout remove 6
```

* Apply a layout on your focused workspace once
This will apply the layout on the current set of nodes on that workspace but newer nodes won't conform to the layout.
```bash
bsp-layout once tall
```

* Go back through layouts
Go back through all (or a custom list of) layouts.
```bash
# Switch to previous layout
bsp-layout previous

# Or to go back through a custom list of layouts
bsp-layout previous --layouts tall,monocle,wide

# For a specific desktop
bsp-layout previous --layouts tall,monocle,wide --desktop 4
```

* Go through layouts
Go through all (or a custom list of) layouts.
```bash
# Switch to next layout
bsp-layout next

# Or to go through a custom list of layouts
bsp-layout next --layouts tall,monocle,wide

# For a specific desktop
bsp-layout next --layouts tall,monocle,wide --desktop 4
```

* Toggle layout
```bash
# Toggle between monocle and tall layouts
bsp-layout next tall,monocle
```



### Configuration

You can configure the size of the master window in percentage in `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/bsp-layout/layoutrc` file.
An example of that file can be found in [`example.layoutrc`](https://github.com/phenax/bsp-layout/blob/master/example.layoutrc)

```bash
mkdir ~/.config/bsp-layout && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phenax/bsp-layout/master/example.layoutrc > ~/.config/bsp-layout/layoutrc;
```
